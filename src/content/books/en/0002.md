What a masterpiece! It's a story of adventure, love, and redemption. The book is full of twists and turns, and it's impossible to put down. The characters are well-developed and the story is engaging from start to finish. The book is a must-read for anyone who enjoys a good story.

In my opinion, it depends. Personally, I think the story is fantastic. And I thought that the first third was amazing, much much better than I expected from a book written almost 200 years ago. You’re following the main characters perspective and it’s so interesting. I was hooked.

However, about 1/3 - 1/2 of the way through the book, the perspective changes from the main character to everybody else’s, and for me it ruined the pacing. Plus, the main character is the one I care about. I thought almost every other character is impossible to empathize with.

Note, I came to the book already loving the movie from 2002. There’s a lot changed in the movie. The movie doesn’t have the same depth as the book, and I’m not going to say that it’s better than the book, but I saw all the things they changed for the movie and I agreed with almost every change. I do think the movie does a better job of actually telling the story in a compelling way. The first third of the movie and the book are very similar, and then the rest the movie makes a lot more changes.

But lots of other people love it, so... it depends. I’d say you should definitely give it a shot. It’s the piece of classic literature I would recommend if I had to pick one.

It is, in my humble opinion, the greatest single story to ever grace this earth and people. A truly masterful tale of revenge that completely eclipses anything else. Although the book itself is a big one, I can safely say that over 1000+ pages I was never bored besides maybe one chapter or so. You would be doing yourself a huge disservice if you didn't read this epic story. I can't praise it enough to be honest lol

The pacing is a consequence of how the book was published. It was published serially, with a new part published every month for 18 months. Due to this, each "part" kind of told a new story, and since Dumas was paid by the word, he was sure to expand everything he could.

It's still a great story, though. I like the movie, but consider it a pretty poor adaptation. My favourite adaptation is Gankutsuou - a Japanese animated version complete with killer robots. It's closest to the tone of the novel.

Edit: the series is Japanese, not Korean.

Here’s the Blair abridgment: ON FEBRUARY 24, 1815, the watchtower at Marseilles signaled the arrival of the three-master Pharaon, coming from Smyrna, Trieste and Naples.

The quay was soon covered with the usual crowd of curious onlookers, for the arrival of a ship is always a great event in Marseilles, especially when, like the Pharaon, it has been built, rigged and laden in the city and belongs to a local shipowner.

Here’s the Buss unabridged translation: On February 24, 1815, the lookout at Notre-Dame de la Garde signaled the arrival of the three-master Pharaon, coming from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples. As usual, a coastal pilot immediately left the port, sailed hard by the Chateau d’If, and boarded the ship between the Cap de Morgiou and the island of Riou.

At once (as was also customary) the terrace of Fort Saint-Jean was thronged with onlookers, because the arrival of a ship is always a great event in Marseille, particularly when the vessel, like the Pharaon, has been built, fitted out and laded in the shipyards of the old port and belongs to an owner from the town.

The abridgment sucks all the joy out of Dumas’ words. The Count of Monte Cristo is a top 5 book for me - do yourself a favor and read the original. (:
